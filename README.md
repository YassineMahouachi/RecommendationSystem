# Recommendation-System
 This recommendation system uses scikit-learn (sklearn) in Python to find the top three products most similar to a user-provided description. It converts text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF, then calculates cosine similarity to measure how closely the input matches existing product descriptions in the database. The system also supports collaborative filtering to refine recommendations based on user interactions and preferences. It outputs the top three most similar products, each with a similarity score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the highest match. This approach, powered by sklearn, is versatile and suitable for a variety of recommendation scenarios, including e-commerce, content recommendations, and job matching.
